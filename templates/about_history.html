                           CivilERA was initially a though of running a society under ASCE(American society of civil Enginners) for which it had to conduct various seminars, Industrial visits, Site visits, workshops etc. for one year with 100% efficiency.
The program was originally started in June 2017, by Dipu Singh, a student of 4th year of 2015-19 batch of Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia, West Bengal. It was his vision to see education mixed with workplace experience within the academic world specially aiming to help the aspirants who are willing to be equipped with the modern technological advancements in the field of Civil Engineering as well as providing the amount of industrial exposure required he was accompanied by Batchmates and his juniors such as Mr. Mayank Kumar (2016-2020),Mr. Abhik Anand (2016-2020) and many other visionaries.
                        <br>
                        As of many institutions with civil engineering department did not practice any additional seminars/workshops/visits etc. to enhance the capabilities of the students under the Department. Every student has the right to develop themselves through various ways in which they can improve themselves as of now there is a huge demand of skilled engineers but we were unable to fulfill the basic requirements of an industry due to lack of practical knowledge.
So as to have practical knowledge and skills we need to learn within an industrial environment where we see how things are actually done respective to the industrial demands. We needed to undergo various workshops, site visit, industry visit to acquire as much as of knowledge we can acquire.
The society then inspected the whole scenario of the ongoing gap between the industry demand and current education system of the country. The theoretical knowledge and the practical knowledge were poles apart during the formation of the society. In order to achieve this, one should not only be well pursuing in academics but also be parallely updated with the how's and what's of the technical achievements of the field. The CivilERA was one such initiative towards the helping the civil engineering students in achieving the kind of excellence that is required.
                        <br>
                        Finally CivilERA was introduced specially for civil engineering students within our own institution aiming at providing a better environment for the students of civil engineering department so as to indulge themselves in various skills development activities for their all round development.
As a part of its continous effort and endeavour to provide a parallel channel for the acadmia and the industry, CivilERA has structured well evolved pro active programs to upgrade the skills of civil engineers and in response has got overwhelming support everywhere.
                        <br>
                        In June 2018, CivilERA has lent an extra dimension to this initiative by announcing the inauguration of the society first in Haldia Institute of Technology which happens to be the lifetime organisation members of CivilERA. This will be a  helpful feature creating an ambiance kf comfort in terms of skill development. The society will be having a mentor from CivilERA who will guide and mentor the pursuing events of such chapters.
CivilERA has been admitting undergraduate students members since 2017. As a part of its continues efforts and endeavour to provide a parallel channel for the academic and the industry, CivilERA has structured well-evolved proactive programms to upgrade the skills of civil engineering graduates.
The initiation is forced towards facilitating those who are facing difficulties in academics with proper guidance and encouraging out of the box approach as well as parallely exposing them to the professional environment which could make them equipped with the required skills to excel.
Taking up this initiative is more a responsiblity than just a programme for us because here at CivilERA, we realize that we the civil engineers are Nation Builders and we accept this role by taking the pledge to put our best efforts in our affairs.
                        <br>
                        We assume that we are always available to be there for any matters concerning the work of CivilERA society. The Team CivilERA is prompt and totally devoted to serve its purpose with zest and zeal.
